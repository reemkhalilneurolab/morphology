# Topological_Sholl_Descriptors

1- All swc files must be groupoed in folders so that results can be compared to the original datasets. 
Pleae note that all the descriptors have no knowledge of the swc groups as they simply convert each swc 
file/tree/neuron into a function and then calculate distances between fuinctions and cluster accordingly. 

2- please all the folders from (1) in the data folder ( Topological_Sholl_Descriptors/data)

3- run main.main

4- Results ( dendrograms , distance matrices ,..) will be in the save folder. ( Topological_Sholl_Descriptors/save)
